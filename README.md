# Hi there 👋
- 🐦 I’m [@wangjacks](https://github.com/wangjacks), a senior high student from China. English is not very good.
- ✍️ Interested in programming and website development, I began learning in 2015. While I've become proficient in building websites, my coding skills are still a work in progress.
- ❤️ My friends have been incredibly supportive on my journey of exploration, so I want to express my gratitude to:
