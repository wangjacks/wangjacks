- Hi, I’m @wangjacks, a middle school student.
- I come from China. My English is not very well.
- I’m interested in coding(specially HTML) and building sites. I started to learn coding in 2015 and began to learn building sites in 2020.
- My friends help me a lot with building sites. So I want to say thanks to:

  - Huangshi
  - Kerry
  - Copur
  - Horatio
  - Lujing
